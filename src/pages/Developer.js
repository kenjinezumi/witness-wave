        Kenji is hard at work... well, he was hard at work. <br /> 
        Now, he's caught up in a battle between coding bugs 🐛 and the ultimate foe: <br /> 
        a never-ending cup of coffee! ☕ <br /> 
        He's currently sipping his way through a caffeine marathon, trying to stay awake 💤 <br />
        as he stares at the screen like a champion 💪. Fear not though! <br /> 
        As soon as the coffee kicks in and his brain gets back into gear 🧠, he'll be right on it! <br /> 
        For now, we recommend grabbing a snack 🍫 or maybe joining Kenji in a coffee break ☕—<br /> 
        because he's definitely coming back soon... probably... after one more cup! 😉
